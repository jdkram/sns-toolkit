# Star and Shadow Toolkit — Tasks Index

**Purpose:** Design rationale, system limitations, and feature specifications.

This file is the index. Full specs live in [`docs/tasks/`](tasks/) split by domain. Links to `docs/TASKS.md` continue to work; follow the table below to find a specific section.

**For work status and priorities:** [CURRENT_WORK.md](../CURRENT_WORK.md)

**Rule:** specs and rationale only — no ❌/✅ status markers. Status lives in CURRENT_WORK.md.

**Also see:** [REWRITE_STRATEGY.md](REWRITE_STRATEGY.md) for technology notes and data migration guidance (formerly SPEC.md sections 10–12).

**Size key:** 🟢 XS (1–4h) · 🔵 S (4–16h) · 🟡 M (16–40h) · 🟠 L (40–80h) · 🔴 XL (80–160h) · ⛔ XXL (160h+)

## Adding a new feature spec

Add it to the appropriate domain file above. Use the next available `9.X` number. Include a sizing label. Add a row to [CURRENT_WORK.md](../CURRENT_WORK.md) to track status.
